## 🤯 About This Madness

### Why Malbolge?
Because apparently, I hate myself and wanted to create the most overcomplicated Pokédex in programming history. Malbolge is:

- 🔥 **Self-modifying** - Code changes itself while running
- 🌀 **Ternary-based** - Uses base-3 arithmetic
- 🎭 **Cryptically encrypted** - Looks like keyboard vomit
- 💀 **Debugging nightmare** - Error messages are in ancient demon language
- 🧠 **Sanity destroyer** - Guaranteed to cause existential crisis

### The Achievement
This Pokédex represents:
- **2,000+ lines** of incomprehensible Malbolge code
- **6 months** of development time (theoretical)
- **47 mental breakdowns** during coding
- **∞ coffee cups** consumed
- **1 legend** created
